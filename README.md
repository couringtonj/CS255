Coursework from CS255-System Analysis and Design
DriverPass was a company that wanted to train people for the driving exam online. They wanted and app that customers could login to and choose a training course, pay and take on the road training as well. They wanted this app available for the PC and mobile. I thought I designed a particularly good wireframe that really shows the interface well. If I could revise one of my documents I would revise the project one system design and put more detail into it. I interpreted the users needs by reading the interview and writing down all they wanted in a app and making it real on the design documents. It is important to consider user needs because they are the ones who are requesting the app (and paying for it) and it also lets the app fit the needs of the users customers. I approach designing software vy following the SDLC and agile methodologies. I use the customers needs to develop a wireframe and a UML class diagram and build the app from there.
